    <h1>The best recipes from my life.</h1>
    <p><em>Hello!</em> This is my first attempt at a website after learning the basics with The Odin Project, I am creating a website about recipes in my life and things I like to do. </p>
    <h2>So, here are the recipes!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><a href=tarragoncreamsauce.html>Chicken In a tarragon Cream Sauce</a></li>
      <li><a href=./cockaleekie.html>Cock-a-leekie Soup</a></li>
      <li><a href=potatoesinbuttersauce.html>Old World Potatoes</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Those are some of my favorite recipes to cook, next let's talk a little bit about the man behind this website. That's right I'm making a myspace in 2023. Deal with it</p>
